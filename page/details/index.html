            Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene was furious on Thursday after Congress passed a '

            Ms Greene told The Independent that she opposed enacting a continuing resolution — necessary 
            to avoid this weekend's deadline to have budgets in place — based on her opposition to US funding for Ukraine in its defence against Russia.

            The Democratic-led Senate voted 77-18, and the Republican-led House follo
            She then claimed the war in Ukraine was "pretty much over."

            The vote split the House GOP in half, with 107 members voting for the bill, and 106 opposing its passage.
            Republicans have long opposed continuing resolutions and a handful of conservatives joined a motion to 
            vacate former speaker Kevin McCarthy when he passed a continuing resolution in September. In response, his replacement, Speaker Mike Johnson, 
            pledged that he would not govern through continuing resolutions.
            Rather, shortly after his election, Mr Johnson shepherded the passage of a “laddered CR” where part of the 
            government spending would lapse on 19 January and the other half on 2 February.wed suit, voting 314-108, in favour of the bill.
